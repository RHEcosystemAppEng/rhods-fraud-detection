# Fraud detection in RHODS using Starburst Enterprise

##### Requirements:

- RHODS working cluster with administrator access
- Startburst Enterprise licence [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]
- Write access to your own Amazon S3 bucket [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]
- Access to a PostgreSQL instance and user with SELECT, INSERT, and CREATE permissions [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]
- Access to the [original dataset](https://gpte-public.s3.amazonaws.com/creditcard_with_empty_values.tar.gz) [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]

#### What is Trino and Starburst Enterprise?

Trino (formerly PrestoÂ® SQL) is the fastest open source, massively parallel
processing SQL query engine designed for analytics of large datasets distributed
over one or more data sources in object storage, databases and other systems.

Starburst Enterprise platform (SEP) is a fully supported, enterprise-grade
distribution of Trino. It adds integrations, improves performance, provides
security, and makes it easy to deploy, configure and manage your clusters.

### Goal

In this document we will cover how to work with the data of the fraud-detection
example with SQL-like queries and an instance of SEP running in the Red Hat
Openshift Data Science cluster.

We will take advantage of several powerful features of Starburst. We will cover reading from/writing to AWS S3, executing federated queries from multiple data sources, in addition to creating materialized views to aid in our data science workflow.

### Steps:

1. Store the features data in S3 [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]

    Upload the
file [features.csv](https://gpte-public.s3.amazonaws.com/creditcard_with_empty_values.tar.gz)
to a bucket called `<PASTE_HERE_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>/data`. In this example, we will name it `rhods-fraud-detection`.
Your AWS credentials **must** have read and write access to this bucket.

2. Store the transactions data in Postgres [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]

    With the file [transactions.csv](https://gpte-public.s3.amazonaws.com/creditcard_with_empty_values.tar.gz) downloaded, execute the following queries in the psql command line tool

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE transactions (
      id SERIAL,
      Time INTEGER,
      Amount NUMERIC(10,2),
      Class INTEGER,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    ```
    ```sql
    COPY transactions(id, Time, Amount, Class)
      FROM '/path/to/transactions.csv'
      DELIMITER ','
      CSV HEADER;
    ```

3. Set credentials and configure Starburst Enterprise [optional when using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)]


    1. Go to the configs directory `cd ./configs`
    2. Update the [01_starburst_licence.yaml](configs/01_starburst_licence.yaml) file with your own Startbust Enterprise license. 
    3. Update the [02_aws_credentials.yaml](configs/02_aws_credentials.yaml) file with your own Amazon credentials.
    4. Update the [03_postgres_credentials.yaml](configs/03_postgres_credentials.yaml) file with your own PostgreSQL server and user details.
    5. Apply the configuration files `cat *.yaml | oc apply -f -`
        <details>
            <summary>Expected output</summary>
        
        ```bash
        $: cat *.yaml | oc apply -f -
        secret/starburstdata created
        secret/aws-credentials created
        secret/postgres-credentials created
        starburstenterprise.charts.starburstdata.com/starburstenterprise created
        starbursthive.charts.starburstdata.com/starbursthive created
        route.route.openshift.io/starburst-web created
        ```
        </details>


    *This next step can be done in one of two ways\*:*
    1. *Follow steps 4 and 5 to process the data in the Starburst WebUI*
    2. *Skip steps 4 and 5 then execute all data processing in the Jupyter Notebook*

4. (Optional\*) Working from the Starburst Web UI

    If you are using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link) then the UI link is in the email which you receive after provisioning.

    Otherwise, log into the Web console of your Starburst Enterprise instance. After exposing it
    with a route, it should be available through the URL `http://starburst-web.<cluster_url>/ui/insights/ide`
    and the configured credentials (`default user: admin`). At this point, you should see the query editor in the web ui

5. (Optional\*) Queries to read and write using Starburst Enterprise
> **Note:** 
> 1. Please click the arrow &#x25B6; below to view and/or copy the query
> 2. Please put your own s3 bucket name in the below queries by changing the placeholder "CHANGE-THIS-BUCKET-NAME". If you are using demo.redhat.com [workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-workshop-fraud-detection.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link) then the bucket name is in the email which you received after provisioning.
